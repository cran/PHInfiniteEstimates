Description: Proportional hazards estimation in the presence of a partially monotone likelihood has difficulties, in that finite estimators do not exist.  These difficulties are related to those arising from logistic and multinomial regression.  References for methods are given in the separate function documents.  Supported by grant NSF DMS 1712839.
